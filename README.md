This program will store the names of all employes in a company extracted from a file, display employee names, add employee names
and delete employee names; as well as write employee names into a file. The program is not functional, names are not admitted and
stored in the tree, but it is shown that names are being pulled from the file. Methods provided are "read_from_file", "insert", "create
node" and "inorder". Reading and printing names in order would only be supported if the program maintained functionality.
